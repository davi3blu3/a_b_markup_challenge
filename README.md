# Markup Challenge

This is my solution to a markup challenge for Alliance Bernstein, building out a web design from a provided Photoshop file.

### Installing

To launch the project locally, `git clone` into your desired location, then navigate into the project directory.

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run a simple local server:

```
npm run-script serve
```

Then you should be able to view the project with a modern browser by navigating to: (http://localhost:8080/), or the address specified in your terminal.

### Notes

I was not able to match the fonts in the project exactly, as Klavika appears to be a commercial Adobe font. I went with alternatives suggested by my version of Photoshop CC. Also in the case of font-awesome icons, I went with free icons where 'pro' versions might have gotten closer to the look provided in the design.

The requirement did not ask for JavaScript, so on smaller screens the menu turns into a hamburger icon, but does not expand on click and is just for demonstration.

In my interview with Shannon, she mentioned she was wanting a developer who would give feedback on designs provided. In this instance, I would want to discuss the 'wayfinding' graphic on the left hand side of major sections in the full design. I was able to emulate the Intro section graphic with different line styles to the right and left of the text. However in subsequent sections, these designs get more complex mixing dashed and solid lines. Because there doesn't appear to be a recognizable pattern, such as the number of dashes visible indicating the section order, I would want to ask if the design might be simplified for the sake of replicating it efficiently. Or if there were a pattern, it would help in building a component to handle the differences.
